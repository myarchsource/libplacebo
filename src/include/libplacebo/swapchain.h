// unknown. A latency of 1 means that `submit_frame` followed by `swap_buffers`

// processing one or two frames at the same time as the user is preparing the

// setting the swapchain size to the values requested by the user, and returns
// in the same variables what width/height the swapchain was actually set to -
// which may be (substantially) different from the values requested by the
// user. A value of 0 means "unknown/none" (in which case, libplacebo won't try
// updating the size - it will simply return the current state of the
// swapchain). It's also possible for libplacebo to return values of 0, such as
// in the case that the swapchain doesn't exist yet.

// Returns false on significant errors (e.g. dead surface). This function can
// effectively be used to probe if creating a swapchain works.

// frames and submit them out-of-order. The frames submitted this way will
// generally be made visible in a first-in first-out fashion, although
// specifics depend on the mechanism used to create the pl_swapchain. (See the
// platform-specific APIs for more info).

// Returns whether successful. This should normally never fail, unless the
// GPU/surface has been lost or some other critical error has occurred.
bool pl_swapchain_submit_frame(const struct pl_swapchain *sw);

// Performs a "buffer swap", or some generalization of the concept. In layman's
// terms, this blocks until the execution of the Nth previously submitted frame
// has been "made complete" in some sense. (The N derives from the swapchain's
// built-in latency. See `pl_swapchain_latency` for more information).
//
// Users should include this call in their rendering loops in order to make
// sure they aren't submitting rendering commands faster than the GPU can
// process them, which would potentially lead to a queue overrun or exhaust
// memory.
//
// An example loop might look like this:
//
//     while (rendering) {
//         struct pl_swapchain_frame frame;
//         bool ok = pl_swapchain_start_frame(swapchain, &frame);

//     }
//
// The duration this function blocks for, if at all, may be very inconsistent
// and should not be used as an authoritative source of vsync timing
// information without sufficient smoothing/filtering (and if so, the time that
// `start_frame` blocked for should also be included).
